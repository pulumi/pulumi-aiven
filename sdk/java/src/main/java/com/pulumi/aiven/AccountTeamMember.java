/**
 * The Account Team Member resource allows the creation and management of an Aiven Account Team Member.
 * 
 * During the creation of `aiven.AccountTeamMember`resource, an email invitation will be sent
 * to a user using `user_email` address. If the user accepts an invitation, he or she will become
 * a member of the account team. The deletion of `aiven.AccountTeamMember` will not only
 * delete the invitation if one was sent but not yet accepted by the user, it will also
 * eliminate an account team member if one has accepted an invitation previously.
 * 
 * ## Import
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aiven:index/accountTeamMember:AccountTeamMember foo account_id/team_id/user_email
