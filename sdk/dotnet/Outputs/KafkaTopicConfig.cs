When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of 'all'. This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write.
