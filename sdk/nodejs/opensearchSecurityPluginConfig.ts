/**
 * Enables and manages [OpenSearch Security for an Aiven for OpenSearch® service](https://aiven.io/docs/products/opensearch/concepts/os-security).
 *
 * After enabling OpenSearch Security management, **you can no longer use Aiven Terraform Provider to manage access controls for that service.** To manage user authentication and access control with OpenSearch Security management enabled,
 * use the OpenSearch Security Dashboard or OpenSearch Security API.
 *
 * **Once enabled, OpenSearch Security management cannot be disabled.** To disable it, [contact Aiven support](https://aiven.io/support-services).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const main = new aiven.OpensearchSecurityPluginConfig("main", {
 *     project: exampleProject.project,
 *     serviceName: exampleOpensearch.serviceName,
 *     adminPassword: opensearchSecurityAdminPassword,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aiven:index/opensearchSecurityPluginConfig:OpensearchSecurityPluginConfig main PROJECT/SERVICE_NAME
 * ```
