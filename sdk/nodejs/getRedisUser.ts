/**
 * The Redis User data source provides information about the existing Aiven Redis User.
 *
 * !> **End of life notice**
 * In March 2024, a new licensing model was announced for Redis® that impacts the Aiven for Caching offering (formerly Aiven for Redis®).
 * Aiven for Caching is entering its end-of-life cycle to comply with Redis's copyright and license agreements.
 * From **February 15th, 2025**, it will not be possible to start a new Aiven for Caching service, but existing services up until version 7.2 will still be available until end of life.
 * From **March 31st, 2025**, Aiven for Caching will no longer be available and all existing services will be migrated to Aiven for Valkey™.
 * You can [upgrade to Valkey for free](https://aiven.io/docs/products/caching/howto/upgrade-aiven-for-caching-to-valkey) before then
 * and update your existing `aiven.Redis` resources.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const user = aiven.getRedisUser({
 *     serviceName: "my-service",
 *     project: "my-project",
 *     username: "user1",
 * });
 * ```
