 * ## # Kafka Connect Data Source
 *
 * The Kafka Connect data source provides information about the existing Aiven Kafka Connect service.

 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const kc1 = aiven.getKafkaConnect({
 *     project: data.aiven_project.pr1.project,
 *     serviceName: "my-kc1",
 * });
 * ```
