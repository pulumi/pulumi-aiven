 * Creates and manages an Aiven for Apache Kafka® service user.

 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const exampleServiceUser = new aiven.KafkaUser("example_service_user", {
 *     serviceName: exampleKafka.serviceName,
 *     project: exampleProject.project,
 *     username: "example-kafka-user",

 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aiven:index/kafkaUser:KafkaUser example_user PROJECT/SERVICE_NAME/USERNAME
 * ```
