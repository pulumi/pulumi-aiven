/**
 * Enables access control for an Aiven for OpenSearchÂ® service.
 *
 * By default, service users are granted full access rights. To limit their access, you can enable access control and create ACLs
 * that define permissions and patterns. Alternatively, you can enable OpenSearch Security management
 * to manage users and permissions with the OpenSearch Security dashboard.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const main = new aiven.OpenSearchAclConfig("main", {
 *     project: exampleProject.project,
 *     serviceName: exampleOpensearch.serviceName,
 *     enabled: true,
 *     extendedAcl: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aiven:index/openSearchAclConfig:OpenSearchAclConfig main PROJECT/SERVICE_NAME
 * ```
