 * ## # M3 Aggregator Data Source
 *
 * The M3 Aggregator data source provides information about the existing Aiven M3 Aggregator services.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const m3a = aiven.getM3Aggregator({
 *     project: data.aiven_project.foo.project,
 *     serviceName: "my-m3a",
 * });
 * ```
