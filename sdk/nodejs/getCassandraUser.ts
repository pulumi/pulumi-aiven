/**
 * Gets information about an Aiven for Apache Cassandra速 service user.
 *
 * !> **End of life notice**
 * Aiven for Apache Cassandra速 is entering its [end-of-life cycle](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/reference/end-of-life).
 * From **November 30, 2025**, it will not be possible to start a new Cassandra service, but existing services will continue to operate until end of life.
 * From **December 31, 2025**, all active Aiven for Apache Cassandra services are powered off and deleted, making data from these services inaccessible.
 * To ensure uninterrupted service, complete your migration out of Aiven for Apache Cassandra
 * before December 31, 2025. For further assistance, contact your account team.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const exampleServiceUser = aiven.getCassandraUser({
 *     serviceName: exampleCassandra.serviceName,
 *     project: exampleProject.project,
 *     username: "example-cassandra-user",
 * });
 * ```
