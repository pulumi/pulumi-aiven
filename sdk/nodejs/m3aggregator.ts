 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const m3a = new aiven.M3Aggregator("m3a", {
 *     project: foo.project,

 *     m3aggregatorUserConfig: {
 *         m3aggregatorVersion: "0.15",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh

 * ```
