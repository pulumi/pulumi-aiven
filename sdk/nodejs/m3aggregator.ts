 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *

 *     project: data.aiven_project.foo.project,
 *     cloudName: "google-europe-west1",
 *     plan: "business-8",
 *     serviceName: "my-m3a",
 *     maintenanceWindowDow: "monday",
 *     maintenanceWindowTime: "10:00:00",
 *     m3aggregatorUserConfig: {
 *         m3Version: 0.15,
