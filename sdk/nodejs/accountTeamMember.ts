/**
 * **This resource is deprecated.** Use `aiven.OrganizationUserGroupMember` instead.
 *
 * Adds a user as a team member.
 *
 * During the creation of this resource, an invite is sent to the address specified in `userEmail`.
 * The user is added to the team after they accept the invite. Deleting `aiven.AccountTeamMember`
 * deletes the pending invite if not accepted or removes the user from the team if they already accepted the invite.
 *
 * > **Teams have been deprecated and are being migrated to groups**
 * **On 2 September 2024** the Account Owners team will transition to super admin. Super admin have full access to the organization.
 * The Account Owners and super admin are synced, so the removal of the Account Owners team will have no impact on your day to day operations.
 * **From 4 November 2024** you won't be able to create new teams or update existing ones. Existing teams will be migrated to groups after
 * this date. **On 2 December 2024** all teams will be deleted and the teams feature will be completely removed. View the
 * migration guide for more information on the changes and migrating to groups.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const main = new aiven.AccountTeamMember("main", {
 *     accountId: ACCOUNT_RESOURCE_NAME.accountId,
 *     teamId: TEAM_RESOURCE_NAME.teamId,
 *     userEmail: "user+1@example.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aiven:index/accountTeamMember:AccountTeamMember foo ACCOUNT_ID/TEAM_ID/USER_EMAIL
 * ```
