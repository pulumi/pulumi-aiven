 * Creates and manages an Aiven for PostgreSQL® service user.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const exampleUser = new aiven.PgUser("example_user", {
 *     serviceName: examplePostgres.serviceName,
 *     project: exampleProject.project,
 *     username: "example-service-user",
 *     password: serviceUserPassword,
 * });
 * // Each service has a default admin user with the username avnadmin.
 * const adminUser = new aiven.PgUser("admin_user", {
 *     serviceName: examplePostgres.serviceName,
 *     project: exampleProject.project,
 *     username: "avnadmin",
 *     password: serviceUserPassword,
 *     pgAllowReplication: true,
 * });

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aiven:index/pgUser:PgUser example_user PROJECT/SERVICE_NAME/USERNAME
 * ```
