/**
 * ## # Data Source Kafka ACL Data Source
 *
 * The Data Source Kafka ACL data source provides information about the existing Aiven Kafka ACL
 * for a Kafka service.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const mytestacl = pulumi.all([aiven_project_myproject.project, aiven_service_myservice.serviceName]).apply(([project, serviceName]) => aiven.getKafkaAcl({
 *     permission: "admin",
 *     project: project,
 *     serviceName: serviceName,
 *     topic: "<TOPIC_NAME_PATTERN>",
 *     username: "<USERNAME_PATTERN>",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
