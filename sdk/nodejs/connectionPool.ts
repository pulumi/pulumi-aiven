/**
 * ## # Connection Pool Resource
 *
 * The Connection Pool resource allows the creation and management of Aiven Connection Pools.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const mytestpool = new aiven.ConnectionPool("mytestpool", {
 *     databaseName: aiven_database_mydatabase.databaseName,
 *     poolMode: "transaction",
 *     poolName: "mypool",
 *     poolSize: 10,
 *     project: aiven_project_myproject.project,
 *     serviceName: aiven_service_myservice.serviceName,
 *     username: aiven_service_user_myserviceuser.username,
 * });
 * ```
