/**
 * The Connection Pool resource allows the creation and management of Aiven Connection Pools.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const mytestpool = new aiven.ConnectionPool("mytestpool", {
 *     project: aiven_project.myproject.project,
 *     serviceName: aiven_pg.mypg.service_name,
 *     databaseName: aiven_pg_database.mypgdatabase.database_name,
 *     poolMode: "transaction",
 *     poolName: "mypool",
 *     poolSize: 10,
 *     username: aiven_pg_user.mypguser.username,
 * });
 * ```
 * <!--End PulumiCodeChooser -->
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aiven:index/connectionPool:ConnectionPool mytestpool project/service_name/pool_name
 * ```
