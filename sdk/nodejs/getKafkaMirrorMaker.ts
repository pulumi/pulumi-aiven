 * ## # Kafka MirrorMaker Data Source
 *
 * The Kafka MirrorMaker data source provides information about the existing Aiven Kafka MirrorMaker 2 service.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const mm1 = aiven.getKafkaMirrorMaker({
 *     project: data.aiven_project.pr1.project,
 *     serviceName: "my-mm1",
 * });
 * ```
