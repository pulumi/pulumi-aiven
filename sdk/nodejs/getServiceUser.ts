/**
 * ## # Service User Data Source
 *
 * The Service User data source provides information about the existing Aiven Service User.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const myserviceuser = aiven.getServiceUser({
 *     project: aiven_project.myproject.project,
 *     serviceName: aiven_service.myservice.service_name,
 *     username: "<USERNAME>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note** The service user data source is not supported for Aiven Grafana services.
