 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const myserviceuser = pulumi.all([aiven_project_myproject.project, aiven_service_myservice.serviceName]).apply(([project, serviceName]) => aiven.getServiceUser({
 *     project: project,
 *     serviceName: serviceName,
 *     username: "<USERNAME>",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
