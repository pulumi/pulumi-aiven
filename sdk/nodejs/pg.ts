 * ## # PG Resource
 *
 * The PG resource allows the creation and management of an Aiven PostgreSQL services.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const pg = new aiven.Pg("pg", {
 *     project: data.aiven_project.pr1.project,
 *     cloudName: "google-europe-west1",
 *     plan: "startup-4",
 *     serviceName: "my-pg1",
 *     maintenanceWindowDow: "monday",
 *     maintenanceWindowTime: "10:00:00",
 *     pgUserConfig: {
 *         pgVersion: 11,
 *         publicAccess: {
 *             pg: true,
 *             prometheus: false,
 *         },
 *         pg: {
 *             idleInTransactionSessionTimeout: 900,
 *             logMinDurationStatement: -1,
 *         },
 *     },
 *     timeouts: [{
