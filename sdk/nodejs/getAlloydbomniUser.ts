 *
 * !> **End of life notice**
 * Aiven for AlloyDB Omni is entering its [end-of-life cycle](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/reference/end-of-life).
 * From **5 September 2025**, you can no longer create new Aiven for AlloyDB Omni services. Existing
 * services continue to operate until the end of life (EOL) date but you cannot change plans for these services.
 * On **5 December 2025**, all active Aiven for AlloyDB Omni services are powered off and deleted, making data from
 * these services inaccessible. The recommended alternatives to Aiven for AlloyDB Omni are:
 * Aiven for PostgreSQL®,
 * Aiven for ClickHouse®,
 * and Aiven for MySQL®.
 * To ensure uninterrupted service, complete your migration before December 5, 2025.
 * For further assistance, contact the Aiven support team or your
