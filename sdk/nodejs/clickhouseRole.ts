/**
 * The Clickhouse Role resource allows the creation and management of Roles in Aiven Clickhouse services
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const bar = new aiven.Clickhouse("bar", {
 *     project: "example-project",
 *     cloudName: "google-europe-west1",
 *     plan: "startup-beta-8",
 *     serviceName: "example-service",
 *     maintenanceWindowDow: "monday",
 *     maintenanceWindowTime: "10:00:00",
 * });
 * const foo = new aiven.ClickhouseRole("foo", {
 *     serviceName: bar.serviceName,
 *     project: bar.project,
 *     role: "writer",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aiven:index/clickhouseRole:ClickhouseRole foo project/service_name/role
 * ```
