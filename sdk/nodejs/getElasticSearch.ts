 * ## # Elasticsearch Data Source
 *
 * The Elasticsearch data source provides information about the existing Aiven Elasticsearch service.

 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript

 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const es1 = aiven.getElasticSearch({
 *     project: data.aiven_project.pr1.project,
 *     serviceName: "my-es1",
