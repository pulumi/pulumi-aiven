        ## # Redis Resource

        The Redis resource allows the creation and management of Aiven Redis services.

        ## Example Usage

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aiven as aiven

        redis1 = aiven.Redis("redis1",
            project=data["aiven_project"]["pr1"]["project"],
            cloud_name="google-europe-west1",
            plan="business-4",
            service_name="my-redis1",
            maintenance_window_dow="monday",
            maintenance_window_time="10:00:00",
            redis_user_config=aiven.RedisRedisUserConfigArgs(
                redis_maxmemory_policy="allkeys-random",
                public_access=aiven.RedisRedisUserConfigPublicAccessArgs(
                    redis="true",
                ),
            ))
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] cloud_name: defines where the cloud provider and region where the service is hosted
               in. This can be changed freely after service is created. Changing the value will trigger
               a potentially lengthy migration process for the service. Format is cloud provider name
               (`aws`, `azure`, `do` `google`, `upcloud`, etc.), dash, and the cloud provider
               specific region name. These are documented on each Cloud provider's own support articles,
               like [here for Google](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/) and
               [here for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] maintenance_window_dow: day of week when maintenance operations should be performed. 
               On monday, tuesday, wednesday, etc.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] maintenance_window_time: time of day when maintenance operations should be performed. 
               UTC time in HH:mm:ss format.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] plan: defines what kind of computing resources are allocated for the service. It can
               be changed after creation, though there are some restrictions when going to a smaller
               plan such as the new plan must have sufficient amount of disk space to store all current
               data and switching to a plan with fewer nodes might not be supported. The basic plan
               names are `hobbyist`, `startup-x`, `business-x` and `premium-x` where `x` is
               (roughly) the amount of memory on each node (also other attributes like number of CPUs
               and amount of disk space varies but naming is based on memory). The exact options can be
               seen from the Aiven web console's Create Service dialog.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: identifies the project the service belongs to. To set up proper dependency
               between the project and the service, refer to the project as shown in the above example.
               Project cannot be changed later without destroying and re-creating the service.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project_vpc_id: optionally specifies the VPC the service should run in. If the value
               is not set the service is not run inside a VPC. When set, the value should be given as a
               reference as shown above to set up dependencies correctly and the VPC must be in the same
               cloud and region as the service itself. Project can be freely moved to and from VPC after
               creation but doing so triggers migration to new servers so the operation can take
               significant amount of time to complete if the service has a lot of data.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['RedisRedisArgs']] redis: Allow clients to connect to redis from the public internet for service 
               nodes that are in a project VPC or another type of private network
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['RedisRedisUserConfigArgs']] redis_user_config: defines Redis specific additional configuration options. The following 
               configuration options available:
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['RedisServiceIntegrationArgs']]]] service_integrations: Service integrations to specify when creating a service. Not applied after initial service creation
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_name: specifies the actual name of the service. The name cannot be changed
               later without destroying and re-creating the service so name should be picked based on
               intended service usage rather than current attributes.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] termination_protection: prevents the service from being deleted. It is recommended to
               set this to `true` for all production services to prevent unintentional service
               deletion. This does not shield against deleting databases or topics but for services
               with backups much of the content can at least be restored from backup in case accidental
               deletion is done.
