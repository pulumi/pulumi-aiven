This setting also gives a bound on the time in which a consumer must complete a read if they begin from offset 0 to ensure that they get a valid snapshot of the final stage (otherwise delete tombstones may be collected before they complete their scan).

For example if this was set to 1 we would fsync after every message; if it were 5 we would fsync after every five messages. In general we recommend you not set this and use replication for durability and allow the operating system's background flush capabilities as it is more efficient.
	FlushMessages *string `pulumi:"flushMessages"`

	FlushMs *string `pulumi:"flushMs"`
	// This setting controls how frequently Kafka adds an index entry to its offset index. The default setting ensures that we index a message roughly every 4096 bytes.

By setting a particular message format version, the user is certifying that all the existing messages on disk are smaller or equal than the specified version. Setting this value incorrectly will cause consumers with older versions to break as they will receive messages with a format that they don't understand. Deprecated in Kafka 4.0+: this configuration is removed and any supplied value will be ignored; for services upgraded to 4.0+, the returned value may be 'None'. The possible values are `0.10.0`, `0.10.0-IV0`, `0.10.0-IV1`, `0.10.1`, `0.10.1-IV0`, `0.10.1-IV1`, `0.10.1-IV2`, `0.10.2`, `0.10.2-IV0`, `0.11.0`, `0.11.0-IV0`, `0.11.0-IV1`, `0.11.0-IV2`, `0.8.0`, `0.8.1`, `0.8.2`, `0.9.0`, `1.0`, `1.0-IV0`, `1.1`, `1.1-IV0`, `2.0`, `2.0-IV0`, `2.0-IV1`, `2.1`, `2.1-IV0`, `2.1-IV1`, `2.1-IV2`, `2.2`, `2.2-IV0`, `2.2-IV1`, `2.3`, `2.3-IV0`, `2.3-IV1`, `2.4`, `2.4-IV0`, `2.4-IV1`, `2.5`, `2.5-IV0`, `2.6`, `2.6-IV0`, `2.7`, `2.7-IV0`, `2.7-IV1`, `2.7-IV2`, `2.8`, `2.8-IV0`, `2.8-IV1`, `3.0`, `3.0-IV0`, `3.0-IV1`, `3.1`, `3.1-IV0`, `3.2`, `3.2-IV0`, `3.3`, `3.3-IV0`, `3.3-IV1`, `3.3-IV2`, `3.3-IV3`, `3.4`, `3.4-IV0`, `3.5`, `3.5-IV0`, `3.5-IV1`, `3.5-IV2`, `3.6`, `3.6-IV0`, `3.6-IV1`, `3.6-IV2`, `3.7`, `3.7-IV0`, `3.7-IV1`, `3.7-IV2`, `3.7-IV3`, `3.7-IV4`, `3.8`, `3.8-IV0`, `3.9`, `3.9-IV0`, `3.9-IV1`, `4.0`, `4.0-IV0`, `4.1` and `4.1-IV0`.
	MessageFormatVersion *string `pulumi:"messageFormatVersion"`
	// The maximum difference allowed between the timestamp when a broker receives a message and the timestamp specified in the message. If message.timestamp.type=CreateTime, a message will be rejected if the difference in timestamp exceeds this threshold. This configuration is ignored if message.timestamp.type=LogAppendTime.

	// This configuration controls how frequently the log compactor will attempt to clean the log (assuming log compaction is enabled). By default we will avoid cleaning a log where more than 50% of the log has been compacted. This ratio bounds the maximum space wasted in the log by duplicates (at 50% at most 50% of the log could be duplicates). A higher ratio will mean fewer, more efficient cleanings but will mean more wasted space in the log. If the max.compaction.lag.ms or the min.compaction.lag.ms configurations are also specified, then the log compactor considers the log to be eligible for compaction as soon as either: (i) the dirty ratio threshold has been met and the log has had dirty (uncompacted) records for at least the min.compaction.lag.ms duration, or (ii) if the log has had dirty (uncompacted) records for at most the max.compaction.lag.ms period.
	MinCleanableDirtyRatio *float64 `pulumi:"minCleanableDirtyRatio"`
	// The minimum time a message will remain uncompacted in the log. Only applicable for logs that are being compacted.
	MinCompactionLagMs *string `pulumi:"minCompactionLagMs"`
	// When a producer sets acks to 'all' (or '-1'), this configuration specifies the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful. If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will raise an exception (either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend). When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of 'all'. This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write.
	MinInsyncReplicas *string `pulumi:"minInsyncReplicas"`
	// True if we should preallocate the file on disk when creating a new log segment.
	Preallocate *bool `pulumi:"preallocate"`

	// This configuration controls the maximum size a partition (which consists of log segments) can grow to before we will discard old log segments to free up space if we are using the 'delete' retention policy. By default there is no size limit only a time limit. Since this limit is enforced at the partition level, multiply it by the number of partitions to compute the topic retention in bytes.
	RetentionBytes *string `pulumi:"retentionBytes"`
	// This configuration controls the maximum time we will retain a log before we will discard old log segments to free up space if we are using the 'delete' retention policy. This represents an SLA on how soon consumers must read their data. If set to -1, no time limit is applied.

	// This configuration controls the size of the index that maps offsets to file positions. We preallocate this index file and shrink it only after log rolls. You generally should not need to change this setting.
	SegmentBytes *string `pulumi:"segmentBytes"`

	SegmentJitterMs *string `pulumi:"segmentJitterMs"`
	// This configuration controls the period of time after which Kafka will force the log to roll even if the segment file isn't full to ensure that retention can delete or compact old data.
